## About

This draft data specification harmonizes contextual data to support the monitoring of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus. Developed in collaboration with [Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE)](https://pha4ge.org/), it provides standardized, ontology-based fields and terms aimed at facilitating comprehensive, accurate, and consistent data collection. Currently implemented through the DataHarmonizer tool, the specification is designed to be adaptable for use in other tools. Supporting resources include detailed field and reference guides, as well as SOPs for data curation and new term requests.

### Contribution Guidelines
We encourage feedback and contributions to improve the specification. However, please note that this is a *work in progress*, and the structure and content are likely to change as the project evolves. If you would like to contribute or propose changes, please open an issue or submit a pull request, or alternatively contact Emma Griffiths at emma_griffiths@sfu.ca

## What are ontologies and how do they improve data quality?

Labs collect, encode and store information in different ways. They use different fields, terms and formats, they categorize variables in different ways, and the meanings of words change depending on the focus of the organization (think of the word “plant”. To someone in agriculture, “plant” could mean an organism that carries out photosynthesis, while a food regulator might understand the word “plant” to mean a factory where food products are made). This variability makes comparing, integrating and analyzing data generated by different organizations like trying to compare apples, oranges and bananas, which is difficult to do.

Ontologies are collections of controlled vocabulary that are arranged in a hierarchy, where all the terms are linked using logical relationships. Ontologies are open source and meant to represent “universal truth” as much as possible (so not tied to one organization’s vocabulary of use case). Ontologies encode synonyms, which enables mapping between the specific languages used by different organizations, and every term in the ontology is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier. Using ontology terms to standardize HPAI contextual data not only helps make data more interoperable by using a common language, it also helps to make contextual data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

## The HPAI Contextual Data Specification Package

This specification is currently implemented via a DataHarmonizer validation template, with accompanying **Field** and **Term reference guides** (which provide definitions and additional specific guidance) and a curation **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**. Please note, this specification is not only available in the DataHarmonizer and can be implemented in any data capture tool, please refer to the field and term reference guides for the data types and picklists.

New terms and/or term changes can be requested through GitHub using the [issue request forms](https://github.com/cidgoh/HPAI_Contextual_Data_Specification/issues/new/choose), with additional guidance on how to do so outline in the New Term Request (NTR) SOP. This resources are available in the files of this repository and listed below under **Package Contents**.

### Version Control

Please note that development of the specification is dynamic and it will be updated periodically to address user needs. Versioning is done in the format of `x.y.z`.

`x` = Field level changes <br>
`y` = Term value / ID level changes <br>
`z` = Definition, guidance, example, formatting, or other uncategorized changes

Descriptions of changes are provided in [release notes](https://github.com/cidgoh/HPAI/releases) for every new version.
